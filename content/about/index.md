I’m pursuing an Integrated Masters in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Coimbatore Institute of Technology, focused on building practical AI systems that solve real problems.

At Elyts LLC, I worked on resume parsing pipelines, PDF-based RAG systems, compliance data extraction, LLM-powered chatbots, and knowledge graph indexing using Neo4j, along with testing multi-agent workflows in an AI workflow builder.

At Finari Services, I built NLP automation tools, OCR systems, predictive models, and speech-to-task AI pipelines. As a freelance AI developer with Raarya, I developed a real-time AI voice assistant using STT, TTS, and RAG for property query automation.
