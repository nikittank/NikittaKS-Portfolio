I’m currently pursuing an Integrated Masters in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Coimbatore Institute of Technology, where I focus on building practical AI systems that solve real problems.

I have worked on AI-driven products at Elyts LLC, contributing to resume parsing pipelines, PDF-based RAG systems, compliance data extraction, LLM-powered chatbots, and meeting data indexing using Neo4j knowledge graphs. I also worked on validating multi-agent workflows inside a no-code AI workflow builder.

At Finari Services, I built NLP-based automation tools, OCR systems for document processing, predictive models for customer analytics, and speech-to-task pipelines using AI services.

As a freelance AI developer with Raarya (Real Estate & Construction), I developed a real-time AI voice assistant using STT, TTS, and RAG to automate customer communication and handle property-related queries.

I enjoy designing complete AI pipelines from data extraction and embeddings to vector search and LLM integration and turning complex ideas into simple, working solutions.

Here are a few technologies I’ve been working with recently:
