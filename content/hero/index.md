I'm currently pursuing an Integrated Masters in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Coimbatore Institute of Technology, while gaining hands-on industry experience as an AI Engineer. I focus on building real-world AI systems using LLMs, RAG pipelines, and knowledge graphs. I enjoy solving complex problems and turning AI ideas into practical, scalable and production-ready solutions.
